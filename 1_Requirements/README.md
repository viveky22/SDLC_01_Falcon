# Requirements 

## Introduction 
In this project the user is able to provide colors present in the rubik's cube as input. Based on the color information provided by the user a small check is done, on whether the colors provided is valid or not. If all the colors provided by the user is valid then the number of steps required to solve the rubik's cube will be displayed using which the rubik's cube can be solved.

## Objective 
The main objectives of this project are: 
* To solve a rubik's cube using beginners method.
* To perform operations on rubik's cube and display the results.

## ***4 W's and 1 H***
## Who
Anyone who doesn't know how to solve the Rubik's cube can use this project.
## What
This project is concerned about solving the Rubik's cube by using layer by layer method.
## When 
Whenever there is an unsolved Rubik's cube this project helps in solving it.
## Why
As this project uses beginner's algorithm it can be easy to teach beginners who does not know how to solve it.
## How
Implemented using structure, pointers, enum and other functionalities of C.

Basic requirements that are very essential are:
* A rubik's cube application or a real rubik's cube.
* gcc compiler with a good system.
* Any of the two linux/windows.
